	* Refactoring Notes
	* 
		* Rename all methods used in card tests to reflect refactored names
		* 
			* 1 per file, not too bad

		* Edit card effect calls to only have correct argument(s) (state and state+handpos)
		* 
			* 1 per file


	* Bug Reports
	* 
		* Ran Fine on adventurer and smithy card after tests
		* Both card tests failed, all unit tests passed (non-card effect related)
		* Card Test 1 Adventurer
		* 
			* Failed
			* No longer causes 2 treasure cards to be drawn
			* returns 1st 2 card drawn
			* Extremely small portion of the time the card could function correctly, i.e. if the first 2 cards drawn are treasure cards
			* bug has every card draw labeled as copper in function but could actually be any card
			* line 679 in dominion.c
			* found by checking if the state of the hand after function call contained 2 more treasure than previously

		* Card Test 2 Smithy
		* 
			* Failed
			* No longer returns with 3 cards having been drawn
			* Only returns 2 cards
			* Line 714 in dominion.c
			* Function never performs correctly
			* Found by checking if the quantity of cards in the hand was 3 more than prior to the function call
